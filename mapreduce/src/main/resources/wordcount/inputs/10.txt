第十章 思嘉与瑞德
瑞德与思嘉在新奥尔良渡了一个不错的蜜月。一年后，他们的第一个孩子出世了。
瑞德：她多漂亮．世界上最漂亮的孩子……是的……今天是你的生日，你知道么？你一星期大了。对……我要给她买一匹全城见都没见过的最好的小马。我还要送你去查尔斯顿最好的学校。对，我会受到南方所有最好的家庭的欢迎。等到她要出嫁的时候，她一定是个小公主。
思嘉：你看你象个傻瓜一样。
瑞德：为什么不，她是第一个完全属于我的人。
思嘉：废话，我也有份的，不是吗？
（敲门声）
媚兰：我是媚兰，可以进来吗？
思嘉：进来，媚兰。 瑞德：快进来，看一看我女儿美丽的蓝眼睛。
媚兰：不过巴特勒上尉，大部分孩子出生时，眼睛都是蓝的。
思嘉：你不用告诉他，媚兰。孩子的事他没有不懂的。
瑞德：无论如何，她的眼睛现在是蓝的，将来也是。
媚兰：象美丽的蓝色旗帜。
瑞德：对，我们就这么叫她吧。邦尼布鲁・巴特勒。
（在卧室，奶妈在给思嘉量腰围。）
思嘉：再量一下，奶妈。
奶妈：20英寸。
思嘉：我要象贝蒂姨妈一样胖了。你一定要帮我弄到18寸半，
奶妈：你生过孩子了，思嘉小姐。你的腰不会再是18寸半了，不会了。我也没办法。
思嘉：会有办法的。我不要变得又老又胖。我不会再要孩子了。
奶妈：我听瑞德先生说明年他想要个男孩。
思嘉：去告诉巴特勒上尉，我决定不出去了。我要在房间里吃晚饭。 （思嘉一动不动地坐在椅子上，目不转睛看着一张照片。那是希礼的照片。瑞德进来，思嘉慌忙把照片翻过来。）
瑞德：我知道了，我让他们把我的晚餐也拿上来。你不反对吧，我希望。
思嘉：不……是，我……我是说不介意你在哪儿吃晚餐。瑞德？
瑞德：什么？
思嘉：你要知道，……我决定，我希望以后不要小孩了。
（瑞德发现了希礼的照片）
瑞德：宝贝，邦尼出生以前我就告诉过你，你生一个或者二十个，这对我并不重要。
思嘉：我知道，但你明白…但你明白我的意思吗？
瑞德：我明白，你知道为这个我会跟你离婚吗？
思嘉：你这么想真是太下作了，如果你有一点风度，你就会好一点。就象…你看希礼・威尔克斯。媚兰不能生孩子了，那他，他……
瑞德：今天下午你去木材店了，是吗？
思嘉：那又有什么关系？
瑞德：又是为那位绅士，那个希礼。再去追他吧，巴特勒太太。
思嘉：没用的，你不会明白的。
瑞德：你知道吗？思嘉，我为你感到难过。
思嘉：为我难过？
瑞德：是的，为你难过。因为你把自己的幸福拱手相送。去 追求一些根本不会让你幸福的东西。
思嘉：我不知道你在说什么。
瑞德：如果你没结婚。而媚兰小姐又死了。你就得到了你珍贵、高尚的希礼。你以为你和他会幸福吗？你从来不知道他的心，从来不理解他，就象你不明白任何事，只懂得钱。
思嘉：那有什么所谓，我想知道的是……
瑞德：你继续坚持你那神圣的爱吧。它不会让我难过。
思嘉：你是说你无所谓？
瑞德：世上多的是别的人，别的事。不会有孤独，我会从别处找到安慰。
思嘉：好，那好。不过我要先告诉你，为了防止你变卦。我要给我的房门上锁。
瑞德：何必麻烦。如果我想进来，没有锁会拦住我。
（思嘉去木材厂里看希礼）
希礼：啊，思嘉，这个时候你怎么会来呀？
思嘉：希礼，我只是……
希礼：你怎么不去帮媚兰准备我的生日晚会呀？
思嘉：怎么，希礼？你应该一无所知呀。如果你没有什么惊喜，媚兰会失望的。 希礼：我不会让她失望。我会是亚特兰大最为惊喜的人了。既然你来了，看一下我们的账本吧。看看我是多么不合格的一个商人。
思：噢，今天不要谈什么帐目了。我只要戴上一顶新帽子，所有数字就会一下从我脑袋里飞走了。
希礼：有这么一顶漂亮的帽子，那些数字也该忘掉，所有的数字都忘掉了。思嘉，你知道吗，你总是越来越漂亮。你和我们在十二橡树最后一次烧烤时一模一样，和当时你坐在一棵橡树下，让十几个追求者围住时一模一样。
思嘉：那个女孩早就不存在了。总是事与愿违，什么都是。
希礼：是啊，从过去开始，我们经历了许多，是不是，思嘉？那些懒洋洋的日子，温暖、宁静的乡间黎明。田间高亢而柔和的黑人的笑声。那些辉煌而又安宁的日子。
思嘉：别想过去，希礼，别想。它伤你的心，让你除了回顾什么也做不了。
希：我不是让你难过，我亲爱的．我只希望你真的幸福。
（希礼拥住悲伤的思嘉。米德太太和英迪亚碰巧进来看见这一幕，无言而鄙弃地离开。现在，思嘉已回到家里，躺在床上。）思嘉：噢，希礼。谁？ 瑞德：还会有谁，你的丈夫。
思嘉：进来。
瑞：我真的被邀请进你的圣殿了！还没准备好去媚兰的晚会吗，
思嘉：我头痛，瑞德。你去吧，我不去了。替我向媚兰道歉。
瑞德：你真是个胆小鬼。起来，你要去参加晚会，而且你要快点。
思嘉：英迪亚有没有……
瑞德：是的，我亲爱的。现在城里男男女女都知道了。
思嘉：你应该杀了他们，他们散播谣言。
瑞德：我作风比较奇怪。我不会因为他们说真话杀了他们。设时间争了，起来，快点。
思嘉：我不会！误会没弄清之前我不能去。
瑞德：你不会因为害怕媚兰小姐当众令你滚出来就欺骗她吧。思：我没做错什么，英迪亚恨我．所以我不能去，瑞德，我不能见她。
瑞德：如果你今晚不露面，今后你就永远不能在这里露面了。即使我不介意，你也要为邦尼着想。为了她，你也要去那宴会。现在穿衣服。穿这件，今晚上你不能穿得太寒酸，或者太庄严。多擦点胭脂，我希望你今晚上踢平常一样。 （在威尔克斯家门口。）
瑞德：再见，思嘉。
思嘉：可是，瑞德，你不能……
瑞德：你自己进这去吧。那些狮子饿极了，等着你呢。
思嘉：噢，瑞德，别抛下我，别！
瑞德：你不是害怕了吧。
（希礼的生日晚会正在进行。当思嘉出现在门口，房内每人都停止了歌声。媚兰装作无所察觉，镇静地上前迎接思嘉。）
媚：多漂亮的衣服．亲爱的思嘉！今晚英迪亚不能来，你能不能帮我的忙？我确实需要你帮我接待客人。米德太太，这是我们亲爱的思嘉。
米德太太：晚上好。
思嘉：晚上好。
女：啊，思嘉，晚上好。
希礼：晚上好，思嘉小姐。
媚兰：希礼，你不准备给我们的思嘉小姐斟林果汁酒吗？
（德园，思嘉在她的房内。）
奶妈：今晚在媚兰小姐的晚会上玩得高兴吗，孩子？
思嘉：高兴，高兴。奶妈。现在，奶妈，你一定要帮我传句话。如果巴特勒上尉回来问到我，就说我睡了。
奶妈：是。
（发生了这么多事，思嘉无法入眠。她偷偷溜到楼下想喝些 酒，然而发现瑞德已在那儿，并喝得半醉。）
瑞：进来，坐下。即使是我在这儿，你也没有理由不可以喝酒的。
思嘉：我不想喝，我听见一些声响就……
瑞德：你什么也没听见。如果你知道我在这儿，你是不会下来的，你一定是很想喝一杯了。
思嘉：我不是。
瑞德：喝吧，别装模作样了。我知道你常一个人偷喝，而且喝的不少。你以为你喝多少白兰地我会介意吗？
思嘉：你醉了。我要回去睡觉了。
瑞：我是醉了．今天晚上我还要再多喝点。但你还不能回去睡觉，还不能，坐下。她很维护你是吗？一个女人，你这样对她，她还为你掩护罪恶，怎么样？你以为她不知道你和希礼的一切吗？你以为她是为了脸皮的缘故吗？你以为她这样做只证明她是个傻瓜，虽然这一切只是为了保全你…・・
思嘉：我不想听。
瑞德：你要听。媚兰小姐是傻，可不是你想的那一种。她只是太高尚了，从不想她所爱的人有什么不光彩。而她爱你，尽管我也想不出为什么她会爱你。 思嘉：如果你不是这么醉，不是这样侮辱人，我会向你解释一切，但现在似乎……
瑞德：如果你敢再离开这把椅子……当然，最可笑的角色还是这个长期受苦的威尔克斯先生，他思想上对妻子不忠，可行为上不能不忠。他怎么不能做个决定呢？
思嘉：瑞德，你……
瑞：看我的手，亲爱的。用它我可以把你撕个粉碎。如果这样可以把希礼永远从你心中赶走，我就会这样做，但是这样没用。所以我要这样从你脑袋里驱走他。我把两只手夹住你脑袋，然后，我把你的头颅象碾一颗胡桃一样碾碎，那他就出来了。
思嘉：拿开你的手，你这醉死鬼。
瑞德：我一直敬佩作的精神。尤其是现在你走投无路的时候。
思嘉：我没有走投无路。你永远也不能要挟到我，瑞德・巴特勒，或者恐吓到我。你低贱太久了，不会明白别的事情。你在妒忌你没法明白的东西，晚安。
瑞德：我妒忌？对，我想是吧。尽管我知道你一直以来对我忠诚。我怎么知道的呢？因为我知道希礼・威尔克斯和他的高贵血统。他是正人君子，而你我都不是。我们不是君子，我们没有荣誉，是吗？
   
Chapter 10 Scarlett and Rhett

(Rhett and Scarlett spent a most-expected honeymoon in
New Orlean. And one year after, their first child is born.)
RHETT: She's a beautiful baby The most beautiful baby
ever...yes... do you know that this is your birthday? That
you're a week old today? Yes...I'm going to buy her a pony
the likes of which this town has never seen. Yes, I'm going
to send you to the best schools in Charleston...yes, and
I'll be received by the best families in the South. And when
it comes time for her to marry, well, she'll be a little
princess.
SCARLETT: Certainly you are making a fool of yourself.
RHETT: Why shouldn't I? She's the first person who's ever
completely belonged to me.
SCARLETT: Great balls of fire. I had the baby, didn't I?
(Knock at the door.)
MELANIE: It's Melanie, may I come in?
SCARLETT: Come in, Mellie.
RHETT: Yes, come in and look at my daughter's beautiful blue eyes.
MELANIE: But Captain Butler, most babies have blue eyes when 
they're born.
SCARLETT: Don't try and tell him anything, Mellie, he knows 
everything about babies. RHETT: Nevertheless, her eyes are blue 
and they're going to stay blue.
MELANIE: As blue as the bonnie blue flag. 
RHETT: That's it. That's what we'll call her. Bonnie Blue Butler.
(In the bedroom, Scarlett is having Mammie measure her waist.)
SCARLETT: Try again Mammie. 
MAMMIE: Twenty inches.
SCARLETT: Twenty inches? I've grown as big as Aunt Pitty. You've 
simply got to make it eighteen and a half again, Mammie.
MAMMIE: You done had a baby, Miss Scarlett. And you ain't never 
going to be no eighteen and a half inches again. Never. And there 
ain't nothing to do about it. SCARLETT: There is something to do 
about it. I'm just not going to get old and fat before my time. I just 
won't have any more babies.
MAMMIE: I heard Mr. Rhett said that he'd be wanting to have a son 
next year.
SCARLETT: Go tell Captain Butler I decided not to go out after all. 
I'll have supper in my room.
(Scarlett sits motionless in the chair, fixing her eyes on a picture. It is 
a picture ofAshley. Then Rhett comes in. Scarlett hurrily turns the 
picture upside down.) RHETT: I got your message. I'll have them 
bring my supper up here too. No objections to that, I hope. 
SCARLETT: No...yes, I...I mean I don't care where you have your 
supper. Rhett? RHETT: Yes?
SCARLETT: You see...well, I've decided-well, I hope I don't have 
any more children. (Rhett notices the picture ofAshley.) RHETT: My 
pet, as I told you before Bonnie was born. It is immaterial to me 
whether you have one child or twenty. 
SCARLETT: I know, but do you know what I...do you know what I mean?
RHETT: I do. And do you know I can divorce you for this? 
SCARLETT: You're just low enough to think of something like that. 
If you had any chivalry in you, you'd be nice, like...well look at 
Ashley Wilkes. Melanie can't have anymore children and he...he...
RHETT: You've been to the lumber office this afternoon, haven't 
you?
SCARLETT: What does that got to do with it? 
RHETT: Quite the little gentlemen,Ashley Pray, go on, Mrs. Butler.
SCARLETT: It's no use. You wouldn't understand. 
RHETT: You know, I'm sorry for you, Scarlett. 
SCARLETT: Sorry for me? 
RHETT: Yes, sorry for you because you're throwing away 
happiness with both hands. And reaching out for something that will 
never make you happy. SCARLETT: I don't know what you're 
talking about. RHETT: If you were free and Miss Mellie were dead, 
and you had your precious, honorable Ashley, do you think you'd be 
happy with him? You'd never know him. Never even understand his 
mind. Any more than you understand anything. Except money.
SCARLETT: Never mind about that. What I want to know is...
RHETT: You may keep your ^sanctity Scarlett. It'll work no 
hardship on me.
SCARLETT: Do you mean to say you don't care? 
RHETT: The world is full of many things and many people. And I'm 
not a shant bit lonely... I'll find comfort elsewhere. 
SCARLETT: Well, that's fine. But I warn you just in case you 
change your mind... I intend to lock my door. 
RHETT: Why bother. If I wanted to come in no lock could 
keep me out.
(In the lumber mill, Scarlett comes to see Ashley.) 
ASHLEY: Why Scarlett. What are you doing downtown this time of day?
SCARLETT: Why Ashely, I just... 
ASHLEY: Why aren't you helping Mellie get ready for my surprise 
birthday party?
SCARLETT: Why Ashley Wilkes. You aren't supposed to know 
anything about that. Melanie'd be so disappointed you weren't 
surprised.
ASHLEY: I won't let her down. I'll be the most suprised man in 
Atlanta. Well as long as you're here, let me show you the books. So 
you can see just how bad a businessman I really am.
SCARLETT: Oh, don't let's fool with any books today. When I'm 
wearing a new bonnet, all the figures I ever knew go right slab out of 
my head. 
ASHLEY: The figures are well lost when the bonnet's as 
pretty as that one. Scariett, you know you get prettier all the time. 
You haven't changed a bit since the day of our last barbecue at 
Twelve Oaks. When you sat under a tree surrounded by dozens 
ofbeaus.
SCARLETT: That girl doesn't exist any more. Nothing's turned out as 
I expected. Ashley, nothing. ASHLEY: Yes, we've travelled a long 
road since the old days, haven't we, Scariett? All the lazy days...and 
the warm, still, country twilight...the high soft Negro laughter from 
the quarters...the golden warmth, and security of those days.
SCARLETT: Don't look back, Ashley Don't look back. It drags at 
your heart till...till you can't do anything but look back.
ASHLEY: I didn't mean to make you sad my dear. I never want you 
to be anything but completely happy. (Ashley hugs sad Scariett. Mrs. 
Meade and India happen to enter the room. Seeing this, they leave, 
wordless and disgusted. Scariett is now back at home, lying in the 
bed.) SCARLETT: Oh, Ashely Who is it?
RHETT: Only your husband.
SCARLETT: Come in.
RHETT: Am I actually being invited into the sanctuary?
You're not ready for Melanie's party?
SCARLETT: I've got a headache, Rhett. You go without
me and make my excuses to Melanie.
RHETT: What a wheg-livered little coward you are. Get
up. You're going to that party and you'll have to hurry.
SCARLETT: Has India...
RHETT: Yes, my dear, India has, every woman in town
knows the story and every man, too.
SCARLETT: You should have killed them for spreading
lies. 
RHETT: I have a strange way of not killing people who
tell the truth. No time to argue, now get up.
SCARLETT: I won't go! I can't go until this
misunderstanding is cleared up.
RHETT: You're not going to cheat Miss Melanie out of the
satisfaction of publicly ordering you out of her house.
SCARLETT: There was nothing wrong. India hates me,
so I can't go, Rhett. I couldn't face her.
RHETT: If you don't show your face tonight, you'll never
be able to show it in this town as long as you live. And
while that wouldn't bother me, you're not going to ruin
Bonnie's chances. You're going to that party if only for
her sake. Now get dressed. Now wear that. Nothing
modest or ^matronly will do for this occasion. And put on
plenty of rouge. I want you to look your part tonight.
(At the door of the Wilkes'.) 
RHETT: Good night, Scarlett. 
SCARLETT: But Rhett, you can't... 
RHETT: You go into the area 
alone. The lions are hungry for you.
SCARLETT: Oh, Rhett, don't leave me, don't! 
RHETT: You're not afraid?
(Ashley's birthday party is going on. As Scarlett shows at the door, 
people in the room stop singing. Melanie pretends to notice nothing 
and goes to greet Scarlett calmly.) 
MELANIE: What a lovely dress, Scarlett darling! India wasn't able 
to come tonight. Will you be an angel? I do need you to help me receive
my guests. Mrs. Meade, here's our darling Scarlett. 
Mrs. MEADE: Good evening. 
SCARLETT. Good evening. 
WOMAN: Why, Scarlett, good evening. 
ASHLEY: Good evening, Miss Scarlett. 
MELANIE: Ashely, aren't 
you going to get our Scarlett a glass of punch?
(Tara, Scarlett in her room.)
MAMMIE: Did you have a good time tonight at Miss Mellie's party 
child?
SCARLETT: Yes, yes. Now Mammie be sure and leave word. If 
Captian Butler asks for me when he comes back, I'm asleep. 
MELANIE: Yes'm.
(Scarlett can not fall asleep, so many things happen, she sneaks 
downstairs and wants to have a drink. And she finds Rhett is already 
there, half-drunk.)
RHETT: Come here. Sit down. There's no reason why you
shouldn't have your '"nightcap even if I am here.
SCARLETT: I didn't want to drink. I heard a noise and...
RHETT: You heard nothing of the kind. You wouldn't have
come down if you thought I was here. You must need a
drink badly.
SCARLETT: I do not.
RHETT: Take it. Don't get yourself airs. I know you drink
on the quiet and I know how much you drink. You think I
care if you like your brandy?
SCARLETT: You're drunk and I'm going to bed.
RHETT: I'm very drunk and I intend getting still drunker
before the evening's over. But you're not going to bed. Not
yet. Sit down. So she stood by you, did she? How does it
feel to have the woman you've wronged '"cloak your sins
for you? You're wondering if she knows all about you and
Ashley. You're wondering if she did it just to save her face.
You're thinking that she's a fool for doing it even if it did
save your hide but...
SCARLETT: I will not listen.
RHETT: Yes, you'll listen. Miss Melanie's a fool, but not
the kind you think. It's just that's there's too much honor
at her to ever conceire of dishonor in anyone she loves.
And she loves you. Though just why she does, I'm sure I
don't know.

SCARLETT: If you weren't so drunk and insulting, I could explain 
everything. As it is though... 
RHETT: If you get out of that chair 
once more... of course, the comic figure in all of this is the long 
suffering Mr. Wilkes. Mr. Wilkes, who can't be mentally faithful to 
his wife and won't be unfaithful to her technically. Why doesn't he 
make up his mind? 
SCARLETT: Rhett you...
RHETT: Observe my hands, my dear. I could tear you to pieces with 
them. And I'd do it if it'd take Ashley out of your mind forever. But it 
wouldn't. So I'll remove him from your mind forever this way. I'll put 
my hand so. One on each side of your head. And I'll smash your skull 
between them like a walnut. That'll block him out. 
SCARLETT: Take your hands off me, you drunken fool. 
RHETT: You know, I've always admired your spirit, my dear. Never 
more than now when you're cornered. 
SCARLETT: I'm not cornered. You'll never corner me, Rhett Butler, 
or frighten me. You've lived in dirt so long you can't understand 
anything else. And you're jealous of something you can't understand.
Good night. 
RHETT: Jealous am I? Yes, I suppose I am. Even though I know 
you've been faithful to me all along. How do I know? Because 
I know Ashley Wilkes and his honorable breed. They're gentlemen. 
That's more than I can say for you and for me. 
We're not gentlemen. And we have no honor, have we?
