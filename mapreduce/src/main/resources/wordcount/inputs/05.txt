第五章 思嘉照料媚兰

（北方人在不断前进。一班伤兵和难民汹涌地逃入凄凉的佐治亚州。而亚特兰大的人只有默默地仰天祈祷。思嘉在医院中做护士，但她忍受不了那儿阵阵死亡的呻吟和嘶叫。）
牧师：耶和华是我的牧者，我不至缺乏。他让我躺在青草地上。他使我灵魂苏醒，领我在可安歇的水边。他为自己的名义引导我走上义路。我虽然走上死荫的幽谷，也不怕遭害，因为你与我同在．你的枝，你的竿，都安慰我。
男：汉密尔顿太太，威尔逊医生在等你呢。
思嘉：让他等吧．我回家了，我受够了。我不要再看见这么多 人死去，听见他们惨叫，够了！
（思嘉奔出医院，来到大街。整个城市正在战火中颤抖，人们四处奔逃。正迷茫之际，瑞德驱车经过。）
瑞德：思嘉！吁！快爬上来．现在可不是散步的时候。他们会把你踩死的。
思嘉：瑞德，请你送我去贝蒂姨妈那里。
瑞德：大恐慌的场面也挺漂亮，是吗？噢，噢，这是舍尔曼将军的又一次战争通牒。他很快就要来拜访我们了。
思嘉：我要离开这，北佬打进来之前离开这。
瑞德：你在医院的工作不管了？是不是那些死亡、跳蚤、切腿去脚的男人让你受够了？我想你可不会去同情那些伤员，思嘉。
思嘉：瑞德，不要这么说了，我很害怕。但愿我能离开这儿。瑞德：让我们一块儿离开这儿。再留下来听那些南方人啼啼叨叨也没有用。这世界上有很多美丽的地方可去，墨西哥，伦敦，巴黎……
思嘉：和你？
瑞德：是的，夫人。和一个了解你．并因了解而仰慕你的男人。我觉得我们是一类人。我一直等着你长大，忘记心中那个满眼忧伤的希礼・威尔克斯。我听说威尔克斯太太这个月 快要生孩子了。爱一个有妻有儿的男人可是件苦差事。到了，你决定跟我走……还是下车？
思嘉：我恨你，鄙视你，瑞德・巴特勒，一直到死I
瑞德：噢，不会的，思嘉，不会那么久的。（汉密尔顿家。思嘉正收拾东西，准备离去。）
米：怎么了，你不是想走吧？
思嘉：你敢拦住我，我再也不回那个医院了。我受够了死亡跟腐烂的味道……我要回家，我要我妈妈，我妈妈需要我。
米：你听我说，你必须留下。
姨妈：米德医生，少一个女伴没什么大不了。
米：天啊，真是妇人。这是战争，不是游园别思嘉，留下来，媚兰需要你。
思嘉：噢，媚兰真麻烦。
米：她已经病了，她不该有孩子，她可能会难产。
思嘉：难道我们不能带她一块走吗？
米：你想让她冒这个险吗？你想让她在崎岖的路上受颠簸，在马车上早产吗？ 思嘉：那不是我的孩子，你来管吧。
米：思嘉，我们的医生不够用。护士更不够，没人去照顾一个病妇。你要留下来陪她。
思嘉：为什么？我又不懂接生。
碧西：我知道！我知道I我全知道。我做过好多次了，让我做医生吧。我一切都会做。
米：好，就全靠你帮忙了。
碧西：好的，大夫。
米：希礼在前线打仗。为我们的事业战斗。他可能永远回不来了．也许牺牲了。思嘉，我们要帮他生个健康的孩子。
姨妈：你要走就快点，思嘉！
思嘉：我答应过希礼一些事。
米：那么你会留下来？好，你走吧，贝蒂菲特小姐，思嘉要留下来。
思嘉：碧西，碧西，快来。收拾我和媚兰小姐的东西。我们马上去德国，北佬来了。
媚兰：思嘉！思嘉！
思嘉：噢，媚兰，我们要去……媚兰。
媚兰：对不起，我要给你惹麻烦了，思嘉，孩子就要出生了。
思嘉：但是，北方借来了。
媚兰：可怜的思嘉，你现在应该在德园陪着你妈妈，是吗？ 如果不是为我。唤，思嘉，亲爱的，你对我太好了。没有什么姐妹比你更好了。我躺在这儿想，如果我死了，你会照顾我的孩子吗？
思嘉：噢，废话，媚兰，事情都到这个地步了，你还说死呀死的，我马上去请米德医生。
媚兰：先别，思嘉，我不能让他在这儿几个小时坐着，医院里那么多可怜的重伤员等着他……
思嘉：碧西，碧西。快来，去叫米德医生。快跑，别站着像只呆羊，快跑，快点。我保证带你回南方，保证！带你回南方！（稍后，碧西一人回来。思嘉只得自己亲自去找医生。）
碧西：医生来了吗？
思嘉：他不能来。
碧西：噢，思嘉小姐，媚兰小姐情况很糟！
思嘉：他不能来，不会有人来。碧西，你要一个人来做．我来帮你。
碧西：唤，太荒谬了．思嘉小姐。
思嘉：怎么？
碧西：荒谬，我们要有个医生，我对生小孩一点也不懂。
思嘉：你说什么？你说过你什么都懂。
碧西：我不知道我怎么会撒谎。妈妈给那些黑人接生时，她不让我看。 思嘉：去，别说了，去给炉子生火，把壶里的水烧开了。拿个线球，还有干净的毛巾，能找到多少就拿多少来，还有剪刀。别跑来告诉我你找不到，快，快去！
   
Chapter 5 Scarlett Taking Care of Melanie

(Atlanta prayed while onward surged the triumphant Yankees...Heads 
were high, but hearts were heavy, as the wounded and the refugees 
poured into unhappy Georgia......In the hospital, Scarlett helps out as a 
nurse there, but her patience was easily suffocated by the dying
and screaming there.)
Priest: With the Lord as my shepherd I shall not want.
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures. With the
sword at my soul. He leadeth me in the paths of
\"righteousness for his namesake. Yea, though I walked
through the valley at the shadow of death, I will fear no
evil. For thou art with me. Thy rod and thy staff, they
comfort me.
VOICE: Mrs. Hamilton, Dr. Wilson is waiting.
SCARLETT: Let him wait, I\'m going home, I\'ve done enough.
I don\'t want any more men dying and screaming, I don\'t want 
anymore.
(Scarlett runs out of the hospital onto the street, where she finds the 
whole city is shaking in the flame of war. Everyone is fleeing. She is 
totally at a loss what to do, then Butler comes with a carriage.)
RHETT: Scarlett! Whoah. Climb into this buggy, this is no day for walking, 
you\'ll get run over. 
SCARLETT: Rhett, ride me to where Aunt Pitty is, please. 
RHETT: Panic\'s a pretty sight, isn\'t it. Whoah, whoah. That\'s 
just another one of General Shermans calling cards. He\'ll be paying us 
a visit soon.
SCARLETT: I\'ve gotta get out of here, I gotta get out of here before 
the Yankees come.
RHETT: And leave your work at the hospital? Or have you had 
enough of death and lice and men chopped up? Well I suppose you 
weren\'t meant for sick men, Scarlett. 
SCARLETT: Don\'t talk to me like that, Rhett, I\'m so scared, I wish 
I\'d get out of here! 
RHETT: Let\'s get out of here together. No use staying here, letting the
South come down around your ears. There are too many nice places to 
go and visit. Mexico, London, Paris...
SCARLETT: With you?
RHETT: Yes Ma\'am. I\'m the man who understands you and admires 
you for just what you are. I figure we belong together, being the same 
sort. I\'ve been waiting for you to grow up and get that sad-eyed 
Ashley Wilkes out of your heart. Well, I hear Mrs. Wilkes is going to 
have a baby in
60
another month or so. It\'s be hard loving a man with a
wife and baby clinging to him. Well, here we are. Are you
going with me or are you getting out?
SCARLETT: I hate and despise you, Rhett Butler. And
I\'ll hate and despise you till I die!
RHETT: Oh, no, you won\'t, Scarlett, not that long.
(The Hamiltons. Scarlett is packing, preparing for
leaving.)
DR. MEADE: What is this? You ain\'t planning on running
away?
SCARLETT: And don\'t you dare try to stop me. I\'m never
going back to that hospital, I\'ve had enough of smelling
death and rot and death...I\'m going home, I want my
mother. My mother needs me.
DR. MEADE: You\'ve got to listen to me. You must stay
here.
AUNT PITTY: Without a chaperone, Dr. Meade, it simply
isn\'t done.
DR. MEADE: Good Heaven\'s woman, this is war, not a
garden party. Scarlett, you\'ve got to stay, Melanie needs
you.
SCARLETT: Oh, bother Melanie!
DR. MEADE: She\'s ill already. She shouldn\'t even be
having a baby. She may have a difficult time.
SCARLETT: Can\'t we take her along?
DR. MEADE: Would you want her to take that chance?
Would you want her to be taunted over rough roads and
have the baby ahead of time in the buggy? 
SCARLETT: It isn\'t my baby, you take care of it.
DR. MEADE: Scarlett, we haven\'t enough doctors, much 
less nurses to look after a sick woman. You\'ve got to stay for 
Melanie.
SCARLETT: What for? I don\'t know anything about babies being 
borne.
PRISSY: I knows! I knows! I knows how to do it. I\'ve done it lots 
and lots. let me doctor, let me. I can do everything.
DR. MEADE: Good. Then I\'ll rely on you to help us. PRISSY: Yes 
Doctor.
DR. MEADE: Ashley\'s fighting on the field. Fighting for the cause. 
He may never come back. He may die. Scarlett, we owe him a well 
borne child. AUNT PITTY: If you\'re coming Scarlett, hurry! 
SCARLETT: I promised Ashley, something. DR. MEADE: Then 
you\'ll stay? Good. Go along Miss Pittifett. Scarlett\'s staying.
SCARLETT: Prissy! Prissy! Come here Prissy! Go pack my things 
and Miss Melanie\'s, too. We\'re to Tara right away, the Yankees are 
coming. MELANIE: Scarlett! Scarlett! SCARLETT: Oh, Melanie, 
we\'re going to... Melanie. 
MELANIE: I\'m sorry to be such a bother, Scarlett. It\'ll begin at daybreak.
SCARLETT: But, the Yankees are coming. 
MELANIE: Poor Scarlett...you\'d be at Tara now with your mother, 
wouldn\'t you? If it weren\'t for me...Oh, Scarlett darling, you\'ve been 
so good to me. No sister could have been sweeter. I\'ve been lying here 
thinking, if I should die, will you take my baby?
SCARLETT: Oh, fiddle-dee-dee, Melanie, aren\'t things bad
enough without you talking about dying? I\'ll send for Dr.
Meade right away.
MELANIE: Not yet, Scarlett. I couldn\'t let Dr. Meade sit
here for hours while, while all those poor, badly wounded
boys...
SCARLETT: Prissy! Prissy come here quick! Prissy, go
get Dr. Meade, run quick! Don\'t stand there like a scared
goat, run! Hurry, Hurry! I\'ll sell you South I will, I swear
I will! I\'ll sell you South!
(Later, Prissy comes back alone. Scarlett has to find the
doctor herself.)
PRISSY: Is the doctor coming?
SCARLETT: No, he can\'t come.
PRISSY: Oh, Miss Scarlett, Miss Melanie bad off!
SCARLETT: He can\'t come, there\'s nobody to come. Prissy,
you\'ve got to manage without the doctor. I\'ll help you.
PRISSY: Oh, lawdsy, Miss Scarlett!
SCARLETT: What is it?
PRISSY: Lawdsy, we\'ve got to have a doctor! I don\'t know
nothing about birthing babies.
SCARLETT: What do you mean? You told me you knew
everything about it!
PRISSY: I don\'t know how can I tell such a lie. Ma ain\'t
never let me around when folks was having them.
SCAELETT: Go! Stop it! Go light a fire on the stove. Get boiling 
water in the kettle. Get me a ball of twine, and all the clean towels you 
can find, and, the scissors. And don\'t come telling me you can\'t find 
them. Go get them and get them quick!
